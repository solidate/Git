The first step we need to do in order to communicate via SSH with GitHub
is to create our SSH key on our local system.

>mkdir .ssh
>cd .ssh
>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Email@web"

Carefully review this line, then press enter.

You'll be prompted where to save this file, press enter to accept the default.
Enter a passphrase, or press enter to have no passphrase.
Once you've verified your passphrase again, press enter

>ls-al


You should have an "id_rsa" file, and also an "id_rsa.pub" file.

>npp id_rsa.pub

Copy the content and add this public key on GitHub

>ssh -T git@GitHub.com
